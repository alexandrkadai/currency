## Test task for front-end position

    Real problem to fix :
    Mounting of components and understade how to ensure that
    fetched data is passing to component is not an empty state.
    First mounting of a component we are getting an empty state,
    then it passes to another component and realy cant map through it cause i`m getting an error that function map is
    not a function.
